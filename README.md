## 👋 Hi, I’m Navroop Gill


- 👀 I’m interested in using Deep Learning and Classical ML to push the boundaries in Ethical AI.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about vision transformers in medical computer vision and NLP. The fun part of AI is that learning is a continuous process, never a dull moment!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...projects that blend computer vision and natural language processing (NLP)
- 📫 How to reach me ...navroopg@gmail.com
